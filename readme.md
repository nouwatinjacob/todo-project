# Todo-Project
 _Codebase for Todo-Project_
## Instructions
* Clone the project
* Generate application keys if not available in env file (`php artisan key:generate`)
* If cloning for the first time, create a .env file, copy the contents .env.example into the new .env file
and continue your configurations
* Create a new database if cloning for the first time and developing locally
* Run composer (and npm?) install
* Seed your database if seeds are available

 **Side note:** Don't forget to clear your cache or restart your server anytime you edit your .env file, 
so that your app will reflect your new changes
